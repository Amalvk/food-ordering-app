# Getting Started with Create React App

Instructions :
1. The API returns the dish categories and the dishes in that category.
2. The dish categories should be slidable.
3. If a dish has addons (“addoncat” in the API), then it should display the text
“Customizations available”.
4. Clicking on the ‘+’ and ‘-’ buttons should update the count accordingly and also
on the cart icon on the top bar.
5. Use any kind of state management (Redux toolkit preferred).
6. Implement maintainable and reusable coding standards.
7. The tabs must not be hardcoded, its length should change as per the API
8. Make sure this project is git versioned.
